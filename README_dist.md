# ion-docval binary distribution

## Introduction

ion-docval is an XML document validator written in Java, which supports validating documents against multiple validation files, and supports multiple validation formats. These formats are:

- XML Schema (.xsd files)
- Schematron (.sch files)
- SVRL Transformation files (.xsl/.xslt files, but only those for SVRL, i.e. those created from Schematron files)

With ion-docval, you can run a local validation service without having to upload your documents to an online validation tool.

This is the same software that is used as part of the [NPa Peppol Test Tool](https://test.peppolautoriteit.nl/validate).
